# Pixel-Player-Asset-Pack

You can download a copy of these sprites and use it in your own game. I drew these sprites not too long ago just to realize I will not be using them for my upcoming BIG game, Salad's Kingdom, so I kinda decided to let you guys use it for your own games or whatever, go crazy with it! as always, pls credit me in the documentation/credits/README of your project. thanks :)
